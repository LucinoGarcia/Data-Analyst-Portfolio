## Huberman Lab Podcast Transcript Extraction - Data Scraping

- Utilizing Python's Selenium package, transcripts for each episode were scraped from [HubermanTranscripts.com](https://www.hubermantranscripts.com/).
- Data reflects updates until April 4, 2024.
- To optimize efficiency and reduce computational load while minimizing impact on website traffic, links were extracted directly from an HTML element on the site.
